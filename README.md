# Memory and Concurrency Project

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of two major projects: Memory Mapping and Concurrency Management. These projects were developed as part of the coursework for IT 306.

## Memory Mapping Project

### Overview
This project demonstrates how to memory map an empty page from the operating system and analyze the memory usage. It includes:
- Memory mapping an empty page.
- Analyzing memory usage before and after writing data.
- Observations on memory stability and operating system efficiency.

### Conclusion
The memory mapping project highlights the robustness of the operating system in handling memory operations without causing noticeable spikes in resource usage.

## Concurrency Project

### Overview
In this project we implemented a multi-threaded server-client system using C, focusing on synchronization mechanisms to manage concurrency. Key components include:
- Definition of constants and global variables.
- Initialization of synchronization mechanisms (mutexes, condition variables, semaphores).
- Server operation and request handling.
- Performance testing and analysis.

### Conclusion
The concurrency project emphasizes the importance of efficient concurrency management in software design. The implementation demonstrates high performance and scalability, with proposed improvements for further optimization.

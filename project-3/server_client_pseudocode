Server-Client Pseudocode


Define constants:
  MAX_REQUESTS - N


Global Variables:
  mutex: lock for shared resources
  cond: condition variable for thread synchronization
  semaphore: semaphore for limiting the number of concurrent requests


Initialize:
  Initialize mutex
  Initialize cond
  Initialize semaphore with MAX_REQUESTS


Server:
  While true:
    Accept client request
    Lock mutex
    If request queue is full:
      Wait on condition variable (cond)
    Add request to queue
    Signal condition variable (cond) to wake up waiting threads
    Unlock mutex
    Create a thread to handle the request



Request Handler (Thread):
  Lock mutex
  Remove request from queue
  Unlock mutex
  Process request
  Lock mutex
  Signal condition variable (cond) if queue is not full
  Unlock mutex


Client:
  Connect to server
  Send request
  Wait for response
  Disconnect from server

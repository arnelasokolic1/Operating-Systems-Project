Pseudocode for Server-Client Concurrency

Global Variables

MAX_THREADS = 10  // Maximum number of threads that can be handled concurrently
current_threads = 0  // Counter for the current number of active threads
lock = new Lock()  // Lock for synchronizing access to shared variables
condition = new Condition(lock)  // Condition variable for managing thread waits


Thread Function: client_thread

function client_thread():
    lock.acquire()
    if current_threads >= MAX_THREADS:
        print("System is overloaded")
        lock.release()
        thread_exitFailure()
        return

    current_threads += 1
    print("Thread arrived and is waiting for service")
    while !service_available():  // Condition to check if the service is available
        condition.wait()  // Wait for the service to become available

    receive_service()  // Call the service function
    print("Service received by thread")
    current_threads -= 1
    condition.signal()  // Notify other waiting threads
    lock.release()
    thread_exit()



Helper Functions

function service_available():
    // Check if the service is available
    // This should return True if the service can be received by the thread
    // Return False if the service is currently busy
    return !is_service_busy  // Replace with actual condition

function receive_service():
    // Code to receive the service
    // Ensure this function is protected by the lock if it modifies shared resources



Main Function

function main():
    threads = []  // List to keep track of all threads
    for i in range(NUM_CLIENTS):  // NUM_CLIENTS is the total number of clients to be served
        t = create_thread(client_thread)
        threads.append(t)

    for t in threads:
        t.join()  // Wait for all threads to complete
